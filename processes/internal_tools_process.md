# Security authorization process for internal tools [draft]

## Summary

CDS uses a wide variety of internal tools [to collaborate and work effectively](https://digital.canada.ca/2018/06/27/tools-to-do-good-work/). This includes Macbooks that are distinct from the TBS network as well as a large number of software-as-a-service tools for software development and team collaboration and communication.

**CDS&#39;s** [**mandate**](https://digital.canada.ca/our-values/) **incorporates experimenting with new digital tools for government, including ones that go beyond unclassified information, in order to inform government-wide efforts to equip public servants with the tools they need.** Developing new processes to more quickly and effectively assess and authorize digital tools also forms part of this work.

As an organizational goal, CDS wants its staff to have access to the same quality of technology and tools as employees at leading technology organizations have access to. This contributes significantly to CDS&#39;s ability to recruit and retain skilled technologists in a government environment.

Achieving this goal depends on quick and clear access to modern tools, including paid versions of SaaS products (which typically have more advanced security and team management features) and the ability to use these products with protected data, which in most cases would be Protected A data. The [Guide to requesting low-dollar value software subscription services](https://drive.google.com/a/cds-snc.ca/open?id=1Vc3cKhlCvakHylmKQQEHc44tffLO7lozQ74aHHRQq2o) outlines how to request paid versions of SaaS products.

**This document outlines the process for approving the use of internal tools (including SaaS products) with Protected A data at CDS.**

## Types of information

Categories of information are defined in the [Directive on Security Management, Appendix J: Standard on Security Categorization](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32614). Information confidentiality is the most relevant of these, given that various CDS activities (design research work, for example) can involve the handling of personal information.

Information confidentiality (outside of the national interest) has four levels, based on the likelihood of causing injury to individuals.

- Most of CDS&#39;s work is **Unclassified** , including nearly all design and software development work outside of user and system credentials. Information about public servants in a work capacity (for example, their work email or phone number) is unclassified.
- Examples of **Protected A** information, in a CDS context, include the contact information of members of the public (for example, the phone number or email address of participants in design research activities). Protected A information, if disclosed, could cause &quot;limited or moderate injury&quot;.
- Examples of **Protected B** information could include Social Insurance Numbers, health information about an individual member of the public, etc. Protected B information, if disclosed, could cause &quot;serious injury&quot;.
- **Protected C** information is typically only used in specific contexts (the Witness Protection Program) and is unlikely to be used in CDS work. Protected C information, if disclosed, could lead to &quot;extremely grave injury… for example, loss of life&quot;.

Note that Protected C information is considered outside of the scope of the process described in this document.

## Background

The steps involved in completing Authority to Operate (ATO) documents vary considerably from one department to another. Formally authorizing (signing off) on using a system with a given category of information is done by the program or service delivery manager.

Under [MITS](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12328) (2004-2019):

> On behalf of the department&#39;s Deputy Head, program and service delivery managers are responsible for ensuring an appropriate level of security for their programs and services. … Relying on the advice and support of the IT Security Coordinator, managers must determine the IT security requirements of their programs and services, have them accredited, and accept the associated residual risk.
>
> For systems or services that are specific to a department, the program or service delivery manager is responsible for accreditation. ([source](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12328))

Under the [Directive on Security Management](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611) (2019), departments are required to:

> (B.2.6) Implement IT security assessment and authorization processes to establish and maintain confidence in the security of information systems that are used or managed by the department, while considering stakeholder security requirements:
>
> …
>
> Implement and document risk mitigation measures when security requirements cannot be fully met before putting an information system into operation, subject to approval by an individual who has the required authority;
>
> Authorize an information system before putting it into operation through established IT security assessment and authorization processes;
>
> Document security assessments and authorization decisions, including the formal acceptance of residual risk by an individual who has the required authority;

In CDS&#39;s case, for internal tools this is CDS&#39;s Chief Operating Officer and/or Head of Internal SRE. For CDS products and services, this is CDS&#39;s Head of Partnerships or Head of Platform, depending on the product or service.

### What is an internal tool?
In this document, &quot;internal tool&quot; refers to products, software, and services that CDS staff use to accomplish their work. This can include computer hardware (e.g. Macbooks), mobile devices for testing (e.g. older Android phones), installed software (e.g. Adobe Creative Cloud), online survey tools (e.g. Qualtrics), and online collaboration tools (e.g. Slack).

CDS-built products and services that support government service delivery, including products and services intended to be used internally by partner departments, are not considered &quot;internal tools&quot; within this document.

### What tools does CDS use?

Subscription tools that CDS pays for (or is considering paying for) are [listed in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfwCl6IkeD4v-OfB90XpeoS26IOdYW_sfQxRhvavc1E/edit).

### Why use a different process for internal tools than for CDS-delivered products and services?

For products and services that CDS is building for other departments, we&#39;re often expected to follow the security assessment and authorization (SA&amp;A) process of the partner department, which ends with ATOs being signed. These processes can take between 3 to 18 months.

For products and services delivered to the public, meeting the traditional expectations of government IT security staff can help build trust, both internally and externally. Completing more extensive, comprehensive SA&amp;A and ATO processes can positively contribute to this.

For internal tools, more streamlined processes are possible while still meeting formal government policy requirements. Doing so helps empower and enable CDS staff, by more quickly providing them with the tools they need to work effectively. Carefully documenting which internal tools are authorized for protected information, and ensuring that this information is appropriately handled by CDS staff, is critical.

### How do I request approval for a Protected internal tool?

1. Complete the [internal tool ATO document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vBfWr5PRKRNYf83WQMTTjDDDkac-tcteOQCQa6P1bgk/edit), by making a copy and adding it to [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B9eacHlx94TH1ojyp-fO-gVHE7g200V8)[Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B9eacHlx94TH1ojyp-fO-gVHE7g200V8)[Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B9eacHlx94TH1ojyp-fO-gVHE7g200V8). The CDS Policy team can help write this.
2. Add the tool to the [subscription tools spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfwCl6IkeD4v-OfB90XpeoS26IOdYW_sfQxRhvavc1E/edit) (even if it is zero-cost), and mark it as &quot;Protected A&quot; or &quot;Protected B&quot; as applicable in the information category column.
3. Email CDS&#39;s Chief Operating Officer (Anatole Papadopoulos) and CC CDS&#39;s Head of Internal SRE (Max Neuvians) with a request for an internal tool approval at the Protected A or Protected B level.
4. The Internal SRE team will coordinate posting the draft internal ATO doc to GitHub for comment, and sending it to TBS IMTD for feedback. IMTD and other applicable stakeholders will be provided three weeks to provide feedback before internal ATOs are sent for the approval of CDS&#39;s Chief Operating Officer. Copies of all approved documents will also be available on internal GC tooling for record keeping purposes, ex: GCDocs, Office 365.
5. For Protected B tools, begin implementing the applicable configuration steps detailed in the [CCCS PBMM cloud profile](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/annex-4a-profile-1-protected-b-medium-integrity-medium-availability-itsg-33).
6. After CDS&#39;s Chief Operating Officer&#39;s replies with an &quot;I approve&quot; email, you can begin using the tool with Protected information (at the level specified in the email thread).

### How long should the internal tool ATO process take?

Writing a draft internal tool ATO template should take 2 to 5 days. The completed document should be relatively short (less than 5 pages).

After completing an initial draft, internal tool ATOs should be published on a GitHub repository (forthcoming) for review/comment. Per step 4 above, TBS IMTD and other stakeholders will be provided three weeks to provide feedback, between when drafts are shared and when final approval is given. Separate products can be sent for review and feedback concurrently.

### What else should I keep in mind?

Use good judgment. Prioritize using products and services that are widely used in the technology industry. Keep an eye out for tools or add-ons that seem phishy or fake, and don&#39;t use them.

Be conscious of the potential sensitivity of the information you&#39;re handling. If you&#39;re not sure, ask someone from the Policy team and/or your manager for help or advice.
